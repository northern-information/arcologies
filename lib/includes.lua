"keeper" is state machine for Cells and Signals

a lot of the "higher order" logic happens here
for example, solariums absorb signals to increase
their charge, then invert their ports and release
once capacity is met. - solariums have charge and
capacity, but don't know exactly what to do with
them. this is where keeper comes in.

furthermore, Signals know nothing about Cells. Cells
know nothing about Signals. keeper:collide() is
the great atom smasher.
